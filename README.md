ill be adding mote here as i go, Right now, if you're testing the game, you'll notice that every once in awhile you'll get pretty far and Jen the game crashes or it's broken and I need to fix it, if you don't want to go through all of the phases of the game anymore, the next time I upload the newest version, then you just have to enter the command set_phase With the number of the phase that you were on. I'll try to put a list of all the phases and their numbers up here later on. But I believe all the beginner phases are 1 through 29, and intermediate phases start at 30 But to use the set phase command do the following in the command prompt. 
set_phase 22
or
set_phase 38
etc
